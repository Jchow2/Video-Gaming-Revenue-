# Impact ofd Gaming Habits on Psychological Well-Being: Anxiety, Life Satisfactions, and Social Phobia 

## Problem Description

Playing online video games has become widely prevalent over the last decade. Consequently, concerns have been voiced in regard to addictive online gaming behavior. At present, research in this area relies on relatively small sample sizes from around 150 to 3500 participants and are mostly focused on narrow cultural backgrounds or only young adults. The present data is the largest openly available dataset comprising of over 13,000 participants from all over the world.

With over 13,000 participants, this is the biggest openly available dataset connecting gaming habits, various socio-economic factors and measures of anxiety, social phobia, life satisfaction and narcissism.

## Data Preparations

This dataset combines survey data among gamers worldwide. The questionnaire consists of several set of questions as asked as a part of psychological study. The original data was collated by Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow from the Open Science Framework (OSF) public databank.

## What are the predictive questions?

Investigate and understand the relationship between gaming habits and psychological well-being, specifically focusing on anxiety levels, life satisfaction, and social phobia among individuals who engage in video gaming.

By analyzing and studying these factors, the project aims to uncover valuable insights into the following:

1. How do different gaming habits relate to levels of anxiety among gamers?
2. Is there a connection between the amount of time spent gaming and an individual's overall life satisfaction?
3. Do certain gaming preferences or playstyles correlate with higher levels of social phobia?
4. What are the demographic and background factors that influence these relationships?

This research can help identify potential areas for intervention or support for individuals experiencing mental health challenges related to their gaming habits. This contributes to our broader understanding of the impact of video games on mental and social aspects of life.
